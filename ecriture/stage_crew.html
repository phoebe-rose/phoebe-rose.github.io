<i>Fall 2015</i>

<br/><br/>
In my sophomore year I joined the technical theater crew at my high school. It wasn't that I was eager to build sets; I was just looking for something to do, something to keep my hands busy alongside an underclassman course load and an absence of other activities. It felt good having some place to go after school other than my room.

Showing up everyday earned me a position on production crew, the group of crewgoers selected to actually run the show. I didn't realize it at the time, but lacking close friends had turned me into a lonely, morose person. I lacked the confidence to speak and the boldness to befriend. Crew members saw me as an introverted, soft-voiced, albeit dedicated member. Things would soon change.

It is extraordinary how bonds between total strangers are able to form and strengthen to a tenacity that threatens the deepest of kindergarten-to-high school friendships. I think it’s because, for hours each day, we’re confined to the same dark corner backstage for five days straight. When we're not moving set pieces, there is really nothing to do but talk. Conversation starts out stunted and unsure, but something about the continuous presence of the other empowers us keep it going — there is no bell to tell us that it's time to part ways — until, without realizing how or when, we suddenly seem to have known each other since preschool. Together we are elated to see actors — student amateurs, but in our eyes young thespians — use our props in scenes we're too jittery to follow. We keep asking when dinner is, and when that time arrives we take glee in the rule that actors must be de-microphoned by student technicians before eating, because this means that the lines for food will be short. We eat in front of the school together when a week ago we were strangers a cafeteria table away. The school building, save the auditorium and the lobby bustling with cosmeticked actresses receiving sandwiches from mom volunteers, is deserted, and we share the same sense of thrill that comes with inhabiting the school at such an unfamiliar hour.

Stage left is essentially a dusty, poorly lit nook on the left side of the stage in a three decade- old auditorium. It's a place where strangers find it O.K. to discretely litter and where I would never sit on the bare ground wearing pants I liked. I don't mind, though, because it's the place a few students gathered to form a family of which I finally felt myself a part. By the Monday after my first show weekend, our lives would return to their usual monotony. For the rest of the student body, it would be an ordinary Monday morning, but for those on crew — each returned to his respective friend group — we would, upon seeing each other in the hallways, lament a post-show withdrawal of which nobody but we together knew.
