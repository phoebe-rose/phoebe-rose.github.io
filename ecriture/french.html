In the seventh grade, I had the option of choosing between Spanish, French and Chinese to fulfill the county-wide foreign language requirement. I ended up choosing French because I thought it was a beautiful and elegant language, [I think this is one of the only valid reasons to study a language and I am proud of my good judgment at the age of eleven.] and in the seven years since then my studies in the French language have become a profound source of enrichment and meaning in my life.

French has always come easily to me. I had an affinity for having a precise working knowledge of things, of preferring to have facts at the ends of my fingertips, and this meticulous aspect of my personality lent well to absorbing grammar rules and vocabulary terms. The workings of the language fascinated me; its grammar and pronunciation were reassuringly regular, but there  was the occasional oddity or exceptional case that gave it personality and charm. I marveled at the little differences that there are when one says something in French and then the same thing in my mother language, English. I loved how it looked, how it sounded. I became excited when product packagings (the nutrition facts on the back of cereal boxes; the little descriptive instructions on cosmetic bottles) had French in addition to the usual Spanish because then I could try to read them. French has always been a thing of immense beauty to me.

From the beginning, French was not confined solely to the realm of school. Drawing has been the hobby that has consumed my free and not free time since childhood. When I began learning French in middle school, my cartoon characters and class time doodles started to carry baguettes in their arms and spawn speech bubbles with the conversational phrases I was learning in class. In high school, I joined stage crew, and the student actors with whom I was consequently surrounded inspired within me a deep passion for singing. In the form of casual web browsing, fate led me to discover troves of French music that have doubtlessly had enormous impact on my development as a person and amateur musician. Lyrics are by themselves poetry, and there are certain intended undertones, subtleties of temperament, fleeting glimpses of the singer's very soul that English simply cannot capture. There are phrases and arrangements of words that can be said in French with a frank look and a sincere voice, but which in English have been tarnished by pop culture to the point where they can be conveyed only ironically as mere dilutions of what they once meant.
