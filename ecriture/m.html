I met M. in eighth grade band. Like he did every year, our band director had each kid play a few notes and would promote him up or down the rows after a few short seconds' evaluation. M. ended up sitting on my left in the second chair of first clarinet.

<br/><br/>
Until then I had never interacted one-on-one with this girl; in a community with a large Asian American population, I spent my time around other Chinese girls. But band comes with a lot of down time, and consequently we began to talk.

<br/><br/>
At first it was shy banter: she would say something, I would reply, we would have a few laughs together. It was difficult for me to talk to somebody outside my immediate circle of friends, but she had a tenacity in attempting to befriend to me that was both strange and flattering. Soon enough I found myself tapping her on the shoulder to initiate conversation myself. We talked about anything and everything, or at least everything that occurred to the minds of thirteen-year- olds.

<br/><br/>
M. was, frankly, my first white friend, and she was because she floated in some realm above petty cliques and social groupings. She broke social boundaries with simple “hellos” but was at the same time entirely unaware of her ability to so effortlessly rearrange the universe of middle school politics.

<br/><br/>
Before we formally met, I knew a little bit about M.; she was charismatic, and that had made her a popular person at our school. She was known for her outrageous sense of humor and ability to deliver incredibly funny jokes and doings and happenings. On picture day she showed up wearing a neon pink poncho and straw sombrero. Her friend's poncho and sombrero accents were orange for the sake of contrast.

<br/><br/>
What took me most by surprise in becoming acquainted with M. were the extents our conversations reached—topics neither she nor I seemed to have thought about before, but in which she seemed to become fluent instantaneously. In the rosy light of eighth grade, concerns of pretension and naivete did not occur to us.

<br/><br/>
M. is intelligent, exceedingly so. She possesses not only a natural brilliance but also an attitude of awe and pure curiosity toward subjects both academic and worldly that is so rare. The more I think back on it as I write this letter, the more extraordinary the clear-sighted, piercing intelligence she had at the age of thirteen strikes me as. Her disregard for frivolities such as outward image and teenage drama—concerns from which young people are rarely able to escape—allows her to excel beyond the point of ordinary comprehension and is, among her other traits, what attracts others to her so strongly. She is her own archetype, a person of an essence so completely singular and unique that she cannot be measured by any scale but her own. She is incredibly, extraordinarily gifted, but somehow approaches the world unassumingly bright-eyed without a trace of ego.

<br/><br/>
By the time eighth grade came to a close, she had changed me from a person reserved and taciturn in the presence of strangers into a person who had to be constantly chastised for chattiness. That summer we parted ways; our middle school was such that the graduating class moved on to two different high schools. But our correspondence never stopped, and the sentence- long e-mails of web slang to which I was accustomed became lost on me as we began to send each other paragraphs of dialogue throughout the summer and beyond.

<br/><br/>
M. transports with her everything that she is, and I am certain that she will find success wherever she goes. In other definitions, she already has found, currently is finding, and will always continue to find success simply because her character prompts it.

<br/><br/>
M. is herself, and nothing more or less. Any better adjectives and descriptions other than those I have used here would still not be able to capture an accurate image of this one girl, a girl who approaches the world without hesitation or preconceptions, who has doubtlessly had profound influence on all who meet her and who is, if the worth of people can be quantified, of a value that nears infinity. Her modesty prevents her from knowing this simple fact: I adore her, and she is the only person in my life who could ask for a peer recommendation to whom I would unfalteringly say yes.
