I’ve always had a thing for older men.

<br/><br/>
A friend of mine recently agreed that men are at their prime between the ages of 27 and 32. The age when they’ve seen what the world has to offer and have grown up a little, but not too much. The most irresistible age.

<br/><br/>
My first substantial crush was my middle school band teacher. He had a reputation for being tough — tough in the context of a brainy public school system — and picked on disobedient kids with a certain viciousness. He also played favorites, and I was one of them.

<br/><br/>
There is no good reason why I was made first chair clarinet the first week of sixth grade. During the two years I had been playing, I never practiced and even left my clarinet in my cubby at school for the sake of convenience. Mr. — had everybody hold a whole note, and when I made my little noise he commanded me with resolution to move up. He had a flair for dramatics, for staged solemnity. With that arbitrary playing test, he dictated the nature of my three years of middle school yet to come. From that point on my existence became about living up to the expectation placed on me that may as well have been placed on any other young clarinetist.

<br/><br/>
He was tall, and trim for his age, with premature salt and pepper hair you wanted to run your hands through. I always saw him from the side; the bridge of his nose was very straight in profile. Dark eyes, dark hair in his youth. A very kissable mole under the left eye. Excellent posture. A low, round voice with some odd inner city accent that came out in the “th” sounds.

<br/><br/>
I pretended to despise him, which didn’t come off as strange because everyone else regarded him with wariness and a profound, secret respect. It’s difficult to control fifty middle schoolers with instruments but he had mastered it.

<br/><br/>
He was seriously impressed with the sound my clarinet produced. I don’t really understand it to this day. It was more my instrument, my mouthpiece and my reed that produced the sound more than the particular grip of my mouth muscles on all that. But he had me play in front of the class all the time and I basked in his attention.

<br/><br/>
I remember a period of time when he would walk from the band room down the length of the cafeteria during seventh grade lunch. We would make eye contact (because of course I was searching him out) and I would wretch with disgust. He would see my reaction and grin. He has this mischievous smile, so different from his normally stoic demeanor, that kind of shocks and charms you all the same. It’s the kind of smile that makes you feel like you did something right. A clever twelve-year-old who thought she was cleaning up her tracks against a grown man. He probably knew very well that I had a crush on him.

<br/><br/>
I want to bump into him in some grocery store and ask him if he remembers me and subsequently get involved in a passionate love affair. It’s been a decade! But he’s probably still the same, just greyer.
